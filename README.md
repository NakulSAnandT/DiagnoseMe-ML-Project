# DiagnoseMe - Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

DiagnoseMe is a machine learning-based project that aims to predict diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease. The project includes a web application where users can choose a specific disease and enter their medical data to obtain predictions.

## Note: This project is currently under development

Thank you for visiting the DiagnoseMe project repository. Please note that this project is still in development, and the code files have not been added to the repository yet. We are actively working on building the necessary codebase and will update the repository soon.

In the meantime, if you have any questions or would like to contribute to the project, please feel free to reach out or keep an eye on this repository for future updates.

Appreciate your patience and interest in DiagnoseMe!

## Features

- Disease prediction: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions for diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease based on input medical data.
- User-friendly web interface: Allows users to select a disease of interest and input relevant medical information for prediction.
- Scalable architecture: Built with scalability in mind, making it easy to add additional disease prediction models and expand the range of supported diseases.
- Regular updates: The project is actively maintained and updated to incorporate the latest advancements in machine learning techniques and improve prediction accuracy.
