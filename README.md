# DiagnoseMe-ML-Project

The primary objective of this project is to build a disease prediction model using machine 
learning algorithms. The model will be trained on datasets containing information on the 
symptoms and medical histories of patients with multiple diseases. The project aims to develop 
a reliable and accurate model that can predict the occurrence of multiple diseases based on the 
symptoms reported by patients. As of now this project is focusing on Diabetes, Parkinsons, Heart 
diseases will include more disease in the future
